    <h1>I Think I Found The Meaning</h1>
    <p>I got super burned out and left my cushy job last year to figure out life, love, and a few stupid things like that.
         <br>I think I finally cracked the code, and below are my findings.<br> 

        <li>
            LIFE : Life is just a combination of 12 straight lines
        </li> 
        <li>
            LOVE : Love is just a combination of 8 straight lines and one circle
        </li> 
       <br> 
        Now, with this new found knowledge, I need to get back to the engine of progress again and start paying my bills. 
        <br>If you have any room in your team for a laidback but hard working software engineer with 5.5 years of Java/Spring boot experience,
